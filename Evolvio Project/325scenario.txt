Scenario Name: Evolvio 

Possible Questions 

1. What is my creature's current health? 
2. How close is my creature to his/her evolved state? 
3. Where is my creature in the Evolvio world at this given moment?
4. What are my creature's predators? 
5. How close is food? 
6. How close are predators? 



Business Rules 

1. A creature can eat varying types of food in order to keep its health up, but it can only 
   eat ONE type of food that will allow it to evolve. 

2. There are 15 species within the Evolvio world, and each has a unique type of food that 
   allows it to evolve. 

3. Creatures can be killed, either by natural disasters, lack of health, or by their predators. 

4. There are 3 different environments within the evolvio world, and each creature comes from only 
   one of these environments. Creatures can travel to different environments. They are less likely 
   to find their evolvedùfood in these other environments, but traveling positively 
   affects their evolved speed. 

5. If a creature is in a different environment than its home environment when it evolves, it 
   will evolve to fit that environment. This means that there are three possible types of 
   evolved states for each creature. Making a total of 45 possible evolved states.
